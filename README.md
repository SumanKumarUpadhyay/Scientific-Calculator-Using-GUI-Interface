This code defines a simple calculator GUI using the Tkinter library in Python. The calculator GUI has buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), clear button, square button (x^2), square root button (√x), and an equals button (=). The calculator supports keyboard input as well.

Key components and features:

1. **Display Labels:** The calculator has two display labels. The smaller one displays the current expression being entered, and the larger one displays the total expression, including the result of calculations.

2. **Digit and Operator Buttons:** Buttons for digits, decimal point, and basic arithmetic operators are created and displayed on the GUI. The buttons respond to both mouse clicks and keyboard input.

3. **Special Function Buttons:** Special function buttons include Clear (C), Square (x^2), Square Root (√x), and Equals (=).

4. **Error Handling:** If an error occurs during evaluation (e.g., division by zero), the calculator displays an "Error" message.

5. **Keyboard Bindings:** The calculator responds to keyboard events, allowing users to input digits and operators using the keyboard.

6. **Styling:** The GUI is styled with different font sizes, colors, and button styles to enhance the visual appeal.

Overall, this code provides a functional calculator with a graphical user interface for performing basic arithmetic calculations.
